This repository contains matlab scripts that generates main figure panels in Uzel et al., Current Biology 2022, A set of hub neurons and non-local connectivity features support global brain dynamics in C. elegans.

note1: Complementary whole-brain imaging datasets that are needed for the scripts can be found in Manuel Zimmerâ€™s public profile: https://osf.io/3vkxn/

note2: These scripts are dependent on many matlab functions and .mat files which are present in the repository.

note3: Some matlab functions are taken from other toolboxes, the details are as follows:

-degrees_dir.m and distance_bin.m are from Brain Connectivity Toolbox (BCT) refer to Uzel et al. 2022 Key Resources Table for full citation.

-padconcatenation.m is from Andres Mauricio Gonzalez refer to the script for more details.

-cbrewer.m is from Charles Robert refer to the script for more details.
